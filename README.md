# Translate-Bot
Translate bot written in python for discord that utilizes the googletrans python package.

Use as you wish, all I ask is that you star it if you use it.  Thanks.


## Commands
    Bot only utilizes one command, `+toggle`, typing that into the channel toggles the translate feature
    on and off (True or False).  So if you have a user that enters your server, you can toggle it on.
